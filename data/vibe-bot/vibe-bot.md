## Overview

Vibe Bot is that bridge. Purpose-built for the physical meeting room, Vibe Bot is a standalone AI teammate that captures everything—automatically, with no extra laptops or manual recording needed.

## Features

*   Capture the room, not just the screen: With a 360° 4K camera, six-mic array, and on-device AI, Vibe Bot sees and hears the full conversation—identifying who spoke, what was drawn, and how ideas evolved, even during overlapping talk or physical whiteboarding.
*   Turn decisions into action automatically: Instead of raw transcripts, it delivers clear summaries with assigned owners—and soon, auto-created tasks in Jira or Asana—so nothing stalls when the meeting ends.
*   Remember across meetings, not just within one: Vibe Bot can link today’s discussion to past commitments, cutting repetition and keeping teams aligned as projects move forward.
*   Secure by design, not by policy: All processing happens locally—no audio or video ever leaves the room. SOC 2 compliant and HIPAA-ready, so your most sensitive strategy stays truly private.
