## Overview

Google Drive offers a generous 15gb of free storage for personal use. The web interface is simple and intuitive, which makes it easy even for the least tech-savvy users to store, access, and share files. The platform removes productivity bottlenecks by allowing remote teams to share files easily with one another and collaborate on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. It’s especially a must-have for the remote teams who produce content or share calendars.
